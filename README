Value proposition:
Instead, I think you have to be able to articulate your value prop using a sentence like this: "Developers want to do X. But they don't want to do Y, so we do it. All they have to do is Z." The more specific and evidence-based this madlib is, the better.

 instead of trying to make their lives easier, you should try and give them super powers or help them do something that's almost impossible. 

 I think a killer feature for any dev product is its trustworthiness.
